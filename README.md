SimpleNews
==========
In the beginning the News-Feed-Reader was implemented to fulfill my requirements of getting the latest news... I really don't like the News&Weather-Application from Google and all the current RSS-Readers in the Playstore are not very user-friendly. Most of the designs are out of date. 

So this is a News-Feed-Reader based on the current State of the Art in User-Interface-Design and Interaction-Design. Feel free to fork and improve the application!
