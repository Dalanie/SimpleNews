SimpleNews
==========
In the beginning the News-Feed-Reader was implemented to fulfill my requirements of getting the latest news... I really don't like the News&Weather-Application from Google and all the current RSS-Readers in the Playstore are not very user-friendly. Also most of the designs are really out of date. 

So this is a News-Feed-Reader based on the current State of the Art in User-Interface-Design and Interaction-Design. Feel free to fork and improve the application or to give suggestions for improving the application!

The app is available in the [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dala.simplenews)

Implementead features:
* hide/show categories and entries
* order and modify categories
* set different colors for each category
* recent viewed articles, favorite articles
* OPML import and export
* import RSS directly out of the browser
* multiple columns view
